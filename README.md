## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Max

I'm currently an SWE Intern at [Security Compass](https://www.securitycompass.com/), and I'm also studying Computer Science at the University of Toronto Mississauga.

### What I'm working on lately
- I'm currently working on my React, Django, and other web development skills at my internship.
- I'm also working on a tool which can visualize transactions between different wallets on the Ethereum Blockchain.

Thanks for checking out my GitHub! Below you can find my contact info:
